SRL Resource Library
=====================

SRL is a library that provides an API for writing bots in Simba for the game Old School RuneScape.

We use the stable build of Simba 1400: https://github.com/Villavu/Simba/releases/tag/simba1400-release

And we support Jagex's new official OSRS client: https://help.jagex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/17160273294097-Jagex-Launcher-FAQ
