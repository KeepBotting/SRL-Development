SRL Resource Library
=====================

SRL is a library that provides an API for writing bots in Simba for the game Old School RuneScape.

We use the stable build of Simba 1400: https://github.com/Villavu/Simba/releases/tag/simba1400-release

And we support Jagex's new official OSRS client: https://help.jagex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/17160273294097-Jagex-Launcher-FAQ

API documentation is available [here](https://villavu.github.io/SRL-Development)

## Usage

We only support the New Official Client from the Jagex Launcher. Thus we only support Windows (and macOS should work too but hasn't been tested yet). We use 64-bit Simba even though the Jagex Launcher is a 32-bit application. We do NOT use RemoteInput or abstract the mouse in any way - this is the responsibility of the user's environment.

To use most scripts, your client options must match ours:
